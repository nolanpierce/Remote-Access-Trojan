# Decided to build a rat
The purpose behind this was for me to get creative and have fun.
It is nowhere near finished but evenetually once it is done you should it expect it fully funcitonal.

## Future Plans
 - Create our payload builder (application that will build and deploy the rat(remote access trojan)
 - Create our communication method to send commands from discord bot
 - Create our mbr stuff that will make it so it says "Missing Operating System"
 - possibly rebuild it in c if i have the time once i finish it in python
