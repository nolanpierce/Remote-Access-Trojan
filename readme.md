# Decided to build a rat
The purpose behind this was for me to get creative and have fun.
It is nowhere near finished but soon it should be!
It will have all sorts of funny pranks you can pull and also some devious features that will allow you
to do some really cool things to windows operating system.

## Future Plans
 - Create our payload builder (application that will build and deploy the rat(remote access trojan)
 - Create our communication method to send commands from discord bot
 - Create our mbr stuff that will make it so it says "Missing Operating System"
 - possibly rebuild it in c if i have the time once i finish it in python
